web browser.

Step 2: By clicking on the "Download" button, you can download the latest version of Ubuntu, i.e.,
Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (long term support).


Creating a Virtual Machine
Now, it is time to create a Virtual Machine. Follow the instructions below to proceed.




Step 1: Open VirtualBox and click on the "New" button.

Step 2: Choose a name for your virtual machine with its location. Based on the name you entered,
VirtualBox will try to predict the "Type" and "Version". Otherwise, from the drop-down menu, select
"Linux" as the type and "Ubuntu" as the version and click on the "Next" button.

Step 3: With the help of the slider, choose the amount of memory (RAM) to be allocated to the virtual
machine. (The recommended memory size is 1024 MB (1 GB). Please note that this memory will only be
used while using a virtual machine).

Step 4: Select "Create a virtual hard disk now" option and click on the "Create" button to proceed.

Step 5: Choose the "VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image)" option and click "Next".

Step 6: Again, click on the "Next" button.

Step 7: Select the amount of space for your virtual machine and click the "Create" button. (This will be
used for your operating system which is going to be installed, so give as much space as possible).

Step 8: When you click on the "Close" button of your virtual machine window (at the top right of the
window, just like you would close any other window on your system), VirtualBox asks you whether you
want to "save" or "power off" the VM. (As a shortcut, you can also press the Host key together with "Q".)
